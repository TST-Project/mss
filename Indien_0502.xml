                  <summary><p>It is a manuscript containing the incomplete paradigm of 125 Tamil verbs. For each Tamil verb, only the first singular person in the present, in the past, and in the future tense is given, along with other two Tamil forms.</p> <p>The listed verb forms are represented by simple or compound verbs, as well as by verb phrases. </p><p>For each Tamil verb form there is also a French gloss where the translation of the whole verb paradigm in the present, past, and future tense is given.</p> <p>The Tamil present and future tense is translated with a French verb in the present and future tense respectively, while the Tamil past tense is translated with a French perfect past.</p></summary>

Upper layout: 100 mm, bottom layout: 350mm.

If there is the paradigm of one single verb there are 20 lines per page (20 folios), otherwise the number increase to 28 (or different) if there is the paradigm of more verbs. </layout>
